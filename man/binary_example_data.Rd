\title{Binary Forecast Example Data}
\format{
A data frame with 346 rows and 10 columns:
\describe{
  \item{value_date}{the date for which a prediction was made}
  \item{value_type}{the target to be predicted (short form)}
  \item{geography}{the region for which a prediction was made}
  \item{value_desc}{long form description of the prediction target}
  \item{model}{name of the model that generated the forecasts}
  \item{creation_date}{date on which the forecast was made}
  \item{horizon}{forecast horizon in days}
  \item{prediction}{probability prediction that true value would be 1}
  \item{true_value}{true observed values}
}
}
\usage{

}
\description{
A data set with (constructed) binary predictions relevant in the
2020 UK Covid-19 epidemic.
}
\details{
Predictions in the data set were constructed based on the continuous example
data by looking at the number of samples below the mean prediction.
The outcome was constrcuted as whether or not the actually
observed value was below or above that mean prediction.
This should not be understood as sound statistical practice, but rather
as a practical way to create an example data set.
